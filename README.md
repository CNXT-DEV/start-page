# start-page
**Demo:** [http://derekbtw.com/start-page](http://derekbtw.com/start-page)

I really like Opera's Start Page but wanted to be able to customize it to my liking. So here it is. Written in pure CSS/SCSS
(with an exception to a few optional lines of JavaScript that open the links in a new tab).

Until I can get to any documentation, everything you need to know is written as comments in the index.html and style.scss files.
