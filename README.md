# start-page

I really like Opera's Start Page but wanted to be able to customize it to my liking. So here it is. Written in pure CSS/SCSS
(with an exception to a few optional lines of JavaScript that open the links in a new tab). I should also add that it utilizes flexbox, too.

Until I can get to any documentation, everything you need to know is written as comments in the index.html and style.scss files. In the meantime, feel free to contribute!
